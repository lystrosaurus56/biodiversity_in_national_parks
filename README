## Biodiversity in National Parks ReadMe

This analysis project is part of Codecademy's Data Scientist: Analytics Specialist career path. I completed this project after finishing the Data Cleaning module. Here, I review and analyze data regarding endangered species observations in four national parks, using two csv files provided by Codecademy (ind included in the repository) as well as some data on park size I found online.

I've also included two presentation files where I summarize my findings - a pdf (which does not include presentation notes) and a PowerPoint (which should include them).
