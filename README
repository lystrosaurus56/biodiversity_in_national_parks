This analysis project is part of Codecademy's Data Scientist: Analytics Specialist career path. 
I used the observations and species_info csv files, as well as data about the size of the parks I found online.
I've also included two presentation files where I summarize my findings - a pdf (which does not include presentation notes) and a PowerPoint (which should include them).
